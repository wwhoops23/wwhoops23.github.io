# FDA DRUG SCRAPE

- The python / Juypter Notebook will product a dataframe with the drug approval data 
- You'll want to add an output line to write the data to CSV, or however else you want to store the data
- There are some months that could not be scraped - there is a flag for those months in the CSV. An update to account for those months is forthcoming, in the meantime I just download them manually and add them to the CSV
