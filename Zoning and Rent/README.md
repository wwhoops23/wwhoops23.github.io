# Zoning and Rent Analysis

## Overview

- This analysis is the starting point for finding a causal effect between zoning changes and rent changes
- As noted in the next steps, there are several areas to expand the work, and a large question is if there is a natural experiment to exploit rather than the current methodology which is exposed to omitted variable bias

## Notes
- DataCleaning.R is run on the zoning and rent data - these files are too big to upload to Github, but are available upon the request
- The resulting data is stored in the .RData file and the R Markdown that produces the final report runs off of that combined data
